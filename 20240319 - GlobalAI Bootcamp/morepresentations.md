## **Multimodal Conversational Interfaces with GPT and Vision AI**

Join us as we unveil GPT-4 Visual, a new model from OpenAI introducing multimodal input and output capabilities. Explore how GPT-4 Visual is integrated into Azure Cognitive Search and supercharged with vision embeddings, transforming our approach to AI-driven information retrieval. Images and videos can now prompt, or supplement prompts, to large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4. We will also introduce new multimodal models for Azure AI Content Safety, part of our Responsible AI product suite.

## **Build your own Copilot with Azure AI Studio** 

Dive into Azure AI Studio - a cutting-edge 'code first' experience to build generative AI applications including enterprise chat and custom copilots. We'll share how to ingest real-time data from Microsoft Fabric's OneLake, test Large Language Models (LLMs), and deploy Proof of Concepts (PoCs) at scale. Join us for a journey of innovation!

## **Vector search and state of the art retrieval for Generative AI apps**

Generative AI apps are powered by a combination of reasoning and knowledge. In this in-depth session we’ll dive into knowledge retrieval, the role of vector search, how hybrid search and reranking models improve relevance, and how recent improvements make it easier to prepare and ingest data into knowledge bases. We’ll ground concepts with live code and data from our extensive evaluations on retrieval quality.
